How is game state communicated to the client?
    - via JSON over a real time connection (WS, pusher, firebase...)


How are moves communicated to the server?
    - via JSON sent over HTTP. The server will provide a RESTful API


What is the responsibility of the client?
    - To display game state
    - To send player actions to the server


Is it important for players to see what other players did?
    - Probably. You should at least be able to see if a player draws a face up card√ü


How are turns handled? How is midturn state handled? (ie, I draw one specific card, and now can draw another)
    - The GameState class has a current_turn_user
    - Basic flow:
        - Player loads game.
        - Current player makes move (POST to server)
        - Server redirects to game

    /games/id/actions/:action

    /games/id/actions/draw_railcar_card, index: 0-4 | random
    /games/id/actions/draw_destination_cards
    /games/id/actions/keep_destination_cards, cards_to_keep: [ids]
    /games/id/actions/claim_route, route_id

How should I handle authorization?
    - Devise

What might game state look like?

{
    current_player: baz

    players: [
        {
            name: 'baz',
            hand: [railcard, railcard, railcard]
            trains: 43
            routes: [routecard, routecard, routecard]
        },
        ...
    ]

    visible_railcards: [
        railcard, railcard, railcard...
    ]

    routes: [
        {
            city_a: 'Toronto',
            city_b: 'Philadelpha',
            cost: 8,
            color: 'red',
            owner: 'baz'
        },
        ...
    ]

}
